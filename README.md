# About This Project

I made this as a bored summer project in 2021. This is my first attempt at creating a first serious roblox game and I spent many hours into trying to make this game. However, I have now (for the most part) moved on to other things so I decided to make this open-source. The code is very bad and confusing, and for that I am sorry. Over the past 2 years as well, there have also been many bugs reported (like the housing system not working) and also biological things like that fact after I created this game I learned that axolotl only live in the water and don't ever venture out to land. But that is no matter! I hope this can help someone out :)

## Getting Started

To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Axolotl-RP.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Axolotl-RP.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
